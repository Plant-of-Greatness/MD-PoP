This was a very fun and strange project, it's the third jam of my life, but definitely the most fun and non stressfull, even if I don't win (probably because of my, less than wonderful music), I still enjoyed the hell out of it, and after I exported I called Phalhandor, my playtester and we just kinda put MEGALOVANIA on loop and vibed, anyway... If you are reading this before you play, hope you enjoy, and after, hope you enjoyed.... Terra Greatness, taking a 48 hour nap
